# calculator-app
Responsive calculator app with 3 different themes, challenge by Frontend Mentor: https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29
Made using Grid CSS, and some JavaScript. 
This challenge is classified as Intermediate level (3), but I found it to be quite easier than some of the Junior level (2) challenges on the same website.
The coolest thing in this project is the 3 different themes. It was nice working on them, but also pretty time-consuming.
This is my favorite Frontend Mentor challenge so far.
It helped me learn CSS Grid and apply it effectively.

I highly recommend this challenge to anyone who wants to improve their front-end skills (like me), or just wants to waste three boring hours of their afternoon (also like me).
